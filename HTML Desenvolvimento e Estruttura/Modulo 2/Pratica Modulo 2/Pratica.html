        <p> Palmeiras is a São Paulo team created by members of the Italian community at the beginning of the 20th century, in the Brás neighborhood, in the city of São Paulo.

        <h2>History of Palmeiras</h2>
        <p>The history of Palmeiras began in the São Paulo neighborhood of Brás, in 1914. At the time, the region was inhabited by Italian communities, who organized themselves to build a sports association that represented them.</p>
        <p>The Palestra Itália team, Palmeiras' first name, was born on August 26, 1914, after a meeting between Italians, Brazilians, two Portuguese and a Spaniard, which decided to establish the sports association. Palestra is a term that, translated from Italian, it can mean gymnasium, gym. In general, it refers to the practice of sports.</p>

        <p>The first time that Palmeiras, Palestra Itália until then, faced Corinthians was in 1918 and won 3 x 0. Six years after the foundation, in 1920, came the first title, when the team won the Campeonato Paulista.</p>
